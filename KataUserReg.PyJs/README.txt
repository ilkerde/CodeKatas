Kata User Reg
=============

A small, very exclusive community wants to provide its members an online library with resources related to individual members. First and foremost, this online community site needs a registration page.

This registration form demands to provide following data for a successful registration:
* a username, in particular without spaces, at least 4 characters long
* an email address, which will be used in a confirmation process after the registration
* a password, minimum 8 characters long, at least containing lowercase, uppercase and digit characters

The password should be requested twice to ensure that the user hasn't been trapped into typos. Of course, passwords may not be shown on the screen. The username may not be already existing in the database of registered users.

Most remarkably, the user registration form needs to be clearly designed. This in fact is business critical, since the community we are talking about is a community of elders. The more easy, but guided the registration is, the better it is for the business.
